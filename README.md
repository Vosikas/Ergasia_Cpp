> Semester Project for the course "Computer Programming with C++" at **Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)**.

## 📝 Overview
This project is a simulation/game developed in **C++** that demonstrates advanced programming concepts. The application visualizes [περιέγραψε με 2 λόγια τι κάνει, π.χ. pathfinding algorithms on a grid / a strategy game map].

The main goal was to implement a complex system using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles without relying on high-level engines, focusing on manual memory management and algorithm efficiency.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
This project showcases the following computer science concepts:

* **Object-Oriented Design:** Usage of Classes, Inheritance, and Encapsulation to structure the codebase.
* **Polymorphism:** Implementation of virtual functions and abstract classes to handle dynamic behavior of game entities.
* **Memory Management:** extensive use of **Pointers** and manual allocation/deallocation (new/delete) to prevent memory leaks.
* **Graph Theory:** Implementation of graph data structures to handle [π.χ. map navigation / connections / routing].
* **Graphics:** Custom rendering utilizing the [Όνομα Βιβλιοθήκης, π.χ. graphics.h / SFML] library.
